# Map Reduce: Gradient Descent
Some statistical models 𝑓(𝑥) are learned by optimizing a loss function 𝐿(Θ) that depends on a set of parameters Θ. There are several ways of finding the optimal Θ for the loss function, one of which is to iteratively update the gradient.Read my article on Medium: https://towardsdatascience.com/map-reduce-gradient-descent-276e6ed0b002
